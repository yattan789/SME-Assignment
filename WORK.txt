PART A and PART B done

Part B --> circular dependency between classes 

Part C --> missing bullet fire function in the enemy as well as player model and controller 
	
IDEA --> Add a bullet class and create a bullet when left / right click pressed through an event listener 
		start bullet from the initial position 
		speed and check-in fame
		also, check any collision with other entity of the game if yes --> destroy
